                Equally important and in more recent times, has been the immense support from the
                great grandson of <strong>Sir Hugh Munro</strong>. It was
                <strong>Lord Colyton of Lindertis </strong>who made it possible for the village to
                develop its Community Woodland which was opened officially in 2007. The provision of
                this wetland offered the ideal conditions required for wildlife habitat and for the
                layout of footpaths. The Community Woodland has proved to be of great value to
                village friends of all ages and abilities. On 25th August 2007 the Woodland was
                officially opened and Lord Colyton&rsquo;s younger son Tom Hopkinson, Great, Great
                Grandson of Sir Hugh, planted a tree to mark the occasion.

                good humour was the predominant feature of a memorable occasion. There were various
                displays for people to enjoy from Lindertis early 1900s to present times. There was
                even a &lsquo;<em>Future</em>&rsquo; display highlighting the fact that a
                crowdfunding appeal had begun that very day towards the provision of a defibrillator
                for the village Phone Kiosk.&nbsp; The most evocative photograph was the one
                (probably by Valentines of Dundee) taken about 1920, and certainly before the
                arrival of the Hall or the Phone Kiosk.</span

                still logged in the Hall Trustees Book. His sister Carmen was also a Trustee for
                over 50 years and she was the representative for the village WRI. The
                <strong>Celebration Coffee Morning </strong>was well attended and the display

                <strong>West Highland Way</strong> compiled by Richard, a member of the Westmuir
                Walkers Group. Richard has completed the route four times and the walk featured on
                the slideshow was perhaps his most memorable.&nbsp; Along the way Richard and team
                met a group of walkers from Denmark who were enjoying every minute of their
                hill-walking in Scotland. The Danes carried their tents, all walking gear, a couple
                of musical instruments and their song sheets (mainly Beatles songs). Richard had
                taken his guitar along and with his family team members had opted for Bed and
                Breakfast.&nbsp; The evening &lsquo;rest times&rsquo; along their
                <strong>West Highland Way</strong> route were indeed memorable, when the Danes and
                Scots met up for a beer and a song. Richard was completing his walk in aid of an
                important charity and when he bid the Danes farewell, they presented him with a
                Whisky bottle container filled with money for his charity.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
                certainly proves that the camaraderie of walking in the Hills does exist.</span

                <strong>Sir Hugh</strong> <strong>Munro.&nbsp;</strong>It was also very exciting to
                learn from Pippa, Lady Colyton that the name <strong>Munro </strong>continues. Their
                eldest son is James Patrick <strong>Munro</strong> Hopkinson and James&rsquo; son is
                <strong>Hugh</strong> Nicholas <strong>Munro</strong> Hopkinson. Lady Colyton
                suggested that &ldquo;Perhaps little Hugh will become a famous man of the Scottish
                Hills like his great, great, great Grandfather although the early indications are

                mountain peaks over 3,000ft highlighted and of course many climbers over the years
                have sought to &lsquo;bag&rsquo; all 282 of them.&nbsp;
                <strong>Jeremy Morris</strong> spoke first about his own journey through the Munros
                and <strong>Isdale Anderson</strong> then described his long distance high level
                trek of the GR20 in Corsica, which runs the length of the Mediterranean Island.

                character of Sir Hugh.&nbsp; He went to Stuttgart aged 17 to learn German and from
                there he developed a love of serious climbing in the Alps. Later he took an active
                part in the Basuto Campaign of 1880 and was awarded a medal and clasp.&nbsp;
                Sometime later he was appointed as a King&rsquo;s Messenger of Foreign dispatches
                which might have required travelling to unsafe destinations.</span

                close to him.&nbsp; In the spring of 1918 Sir Hugh went over to Tarascon in Provence
                with his two daughters Carmen and Morna. Working with the French Red Cross and aided
                by his daughters, he set up his own Canteen to aid soldiers. In January 1919 all
                three returned to Tarascon to work in the Canteen and to help the troops returning
                from the war.&nbsp; Sadly, Sir Hugh became seriously ill and died on 19th March
                1919.&nbsp; His funeral procession at Lindertis on 2nd April was followed by pupils
                and teachers from Westmuir School, Airlie School and Kingoldrum School also the
                Tennantry and staff from Lindertis and many friends and family.</span

            In 1808 Gilbert Laing Meason purchased the lands of Lindertis, which lies about four
            miles west of Kirriemuir on the north side of the road leading to Blairgowrie. He was
            the 2nd son of Robert Laing the Laird of Strynzie in Orkney and succeed his Cousin
            Gilbert Meason of Moredon, by whose deed of settlement in 1808, took the name and arms
            of Meason.&nbsp; Through his marriage in 1811 to Mary, daughter of William Weymss of
            Cuttlehill, their combined fortune was considerable, and it was lavishly spent on their
            newly acquired property. Between 1814 and 1817 they had the square Castellated House
            built which formed the main building, the design having been drawn up by Elliot of
            Edinburgh in 1813.

            The policies and gardens had also been laid out by Mr Laing Meason. In fact everything
            was done on a grand scale, with the result that when he died in 1832, his son Magnus
            Laing-Meason fell into financial difficulties and Lindertis was sold in 1838, on behalf
            of the creditors, to the Trustees of
            <strong>Major-General Sir Thomas Munro, Baronet,</strong> who had died in India in 1827.
            By his settlement a certain portion of the considerable fortune which he left to his
            elder son and heir to the Baronetcy was to be invested in land. Lindertis was purchased
            and managed until their ward came of age.

            <strong>Thomas Munro, Second Baronet</strong> was born in India in 1819; he made
            additions to the estate with the purchase of Auchendorie and Baldovie in the 1860s. In
            1864 he made considerable additions to the Lindertis House, one of these being the west
            wing. <strong> Sir Thomas</strong> was never married so on his death in 1901, his
            younger brother <strong>Campbell Munro </strong>became <strong>Third Baronet</strong>.
            <strong>Sir Campbell</strong> was born in India in 1823 and he chose the army as a
            career rising to the rank of Captain in the Grenadier Guards. Through his marriage in
            1853 to Henrietta Maria Drummond they had nine of a family, of whom the eldest was
            <strong>Hugh Thomas.</strong>

            <strong>Hugh Thomas Munro, Fourth Baronet,</strong> was born in 1856. In 1899 the lands
            of Lindertis and Baldovie were conveyed to him by his uncle,
            <strong>Sir Thomas Munro</strong>, and on his father's death in 1913 he took the title
            4th Baronet. <strong>Sir Hugh Munro</strong> is best remembered for his table of
            Scottish mountains of 3000 feet and over which was published in 1891 in the Scottish
            Mountaineering Club Journal. This caused a great stir among active mountaineers, who saw
            the challenge of climbing all the mountains on the list as a lifetime ambition. Of his
            total of 538 main summits and tops, it is reckoned he had only 3 summits still to climb
            when he died in France in 1919. His son <strong>Torquil,</strong> becoming the 5th

            /><strong>Thomas Torquil Alfonso Munro, Fifth Baronet</strong>, was born in Edinburgh in
            1901 and educated at Winchester. He was best known as a farmer, particularly as an
            Aberdeen Angus breeder and Judge. He got his name in the record books when his Aberdeen
            Angus bull 'Lindertis Evulse' was sold at the Perth Bull Sales, in 1963, for the world
            record price of 60,000 guineas. Many of his other championship bulls were exported to
            other countries. Sir Torquil was well known in his younger days as a host for society
            parties which were attended by pre-war British film stars and for many years he was one
            of the organisers of the Angus County Ball, which he attended in red kilt, jacket and
            red stockings. In 1928 Torquil made it possible for the people of
            <strong>Westmuir</strong> to erect their village hall with the gift of a piece of land.

            By <strong>1947</strong> with the family living in the nearby Drumleys House and the
            large mansion house becoming more of a burden than an asset, the main building was
            stripped of all valuable building materials. Special care was taken with the library,
            with its roll-shuttered walnut bookcases and doors that resembled shelves of books.

            was converted into flats which were last occupied in 1965/6. For health and safety
            reasons, children playing in the buildings, lighting fires etc., all of buildings were
            finally demolished in <strong>1987</strong>.

            &quot;We arrived around 1957, moving from Letham, Angus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a pupil at
            Forfar Academy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I left Forfar Academy, after five years' senior secondary
            education, with an Intermediate Swimming Certificate, which I passed by rescuing a
            drowning brick from the bottom of Forfar Swimming Pool while dressed in my pyjamasl
            <br />
            <br />
            I was therefore very grateful to Willie Ogilvy, chief printer at the Kirriemuir Herald,
            for my first job as his reporter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was with the Herald, or as it was more
            unkindly known, the two minutes' silence, for eighteen months, during which time the
            McGugans moved from &quot;Carraig&quot; to a house my Dad had had built at the Welton
            Corner, between Forfar and Kingsmuir.<br />
            <br />
            Among my most vivid memories of my time in Westmuir are riding my sister's pony through
            the raspberry fields and up the hills over the road opposite the house: illegally
            driving my Dad's car, while under age, along the great straight stretch of road towards
            Alyth; and the great teenage parties we held in the what used to be the billiard room in
            &quot;Carraig.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
            <br />
            As we were at the bottom of the hill out of Kirriemuir, any time there was a serious
            snowfall the family played host to stranded lorry and car drivers. &nbsp; I remember my
            parents were thanked by one guy from up Glen Isla with a whole side of
            venison.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
            <br />
            I first started acting around the time I lived in Westmuir, joining the Thrums Dramatic
            Society and the Kirriemuir Amateur Operatic Society - both &nbsp;great places to meet
            girls!&nbsp; One play, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; by Falkland L Cary - weird the useless
            pieces of information which stick in the mind - toured to Lintrathen. &nbsp; The local
            hall was packed, kids in the front rows, courting couples in the middle, Mums and Dads
            keeping an eye on it all at the back.&nbsp; There was a long tea-party scene and we were
            stuck at the very edge of the tiny stage. &nbsp; We were so close to the front row that
            when I got up to leave the tea-party, I discovered someone had tied my shoe-laces
            together....<br />
            <br />
            After a clutch of newspaper jobs I went to the College of Dramatic Art in Glasgow for
            three years, and I've been in the acting business ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has
            ranged from seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre and
            theatre tours to television shows and series like &quot;It Ain't HAlf Hot, Mum,&quot;
            &quot;Playschool,&quot; &quot;The Chief,&quot; &quot;Tutti Frutti,&quot; &quot;Hamish
            MacBeth,&quot;&quot;Benidorm&quot; etc., etc.<br />
            <br />
            There is one long-lasting response to my stay in Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later I
            took a rush of blood to the head and bought a house in the Languedoc region of the south
            of France. &nbsp; I didn't realise it at the time, but I've since noticed that the view
            from the house in France is identical to the wonderful view I had from my top-floor
            bedroom in &quot;Carraig.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you substitute the sunflowers with
            potatoes and the vines with rasps you've got the same sweeping view from Westmuir down
            the Strathmore valley, with Forfar over to the left, and down towards Perth on the
            right.&nbsp; Only in France with more predictable sunshine.....&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Very best wishes,<br />
            Stuart.

              >Northmuir, Southmuir and Westmuir were specifically created by the Kirriemuir
              authorities in 1815 ostensibly to allow the town to develop.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Westmuir
              more than thirty smallholdings were laid out to enable handloom weavers and their
              families to practise self-sufficiency whilst plying their trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; However
              there is evidence to suggest that all three hamlets were located on the edges of the
              town/parish boundaries in order to deter local farmers who were encroaching on the
              town&rsquo;s common lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would explain why the Westmuir is a mile
              out of town and not at Herdhill. About a third of the initial buildings survive in one
              form or another and many of the smallholdings and their wells can be
              located.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition at least two communal wells were sunk outside the
              present shop and in <strong>Roman Road</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the smallholdings
              were located along the Airlie/Kirriemuir road which bisects the
              village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most were sited to the north and south of the main
              road and were reached by paths between the plots and fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
              footpaths in time developed into the four side roads on which most of the village
              housing is now to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
            >
          </div>
          <p>
            To the north of the main road lie <strong>East</strong> and <strong>West Bank</strong>,
            the latter was and sometimes still is known as <strong>Old School Road</strong> or
            <strong>School Brae</strong>, names which explain why it came into use in the 1870s to
            service the new village school.&nbsp; Prior to that date early O.S. maps indicate that
            the western houses of the village were accessed by &lsquo;the Strippie&rsquo; now a wide
            but partially overgrown footpath between the Parish Boundary mound and the property
            boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title is not as one might presuppose a familiar diminutive
            common to locals &ndash; as with &lsquo;Shoppie&rsquo;,&nbsp; but is an actual Old Scots
            term for an approach road.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>East Bank</strong> sometimes known as <strong>Rossiebank</strong> from the
            property at the northern end certainly predates the 1815 village and was the trackway
            which led to <strong>Cloisterbank</strong> whose buildings have disappeared in the last
            fifty years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This farm was reputed to be the site of the late 18thC
            confrontation between the townsfolk of Kirriemuir and the surrounding farmers when
            disagreements over the hoarding and price of grain led to the fisticuffs described in
            Reid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Regality of Kirriemuir&rsquo; as the
            <strong>Battle of Cloisterbank</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the name itself may well
            suggest even greater antiquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1202 A.D.&nbsp; Gilchrist, Earl of Angus
            gifted Kirriemuir Parish Church and the lands which sustained it to the Abbey at
            Arbroath as part of the Abbey&rsquo;s fund-raising to contribute to the fourth
            Crusade.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not impossible that CLOISTER bank may well relate to some of
            the arable and grazing lands so gifted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be that these rents
            partially financed the sack of Constantinople in 1204?
          </p>
          <p>
            South of the main road lie the Low Road and Roman Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the
            former has always been referred to as The &nbsp;<strong>Low Road</strong> may well
            indicate that in the early years this was the major access route to the lower and
            southern part of the settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly a substantial number of the older
            houses of the village were adjacent to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In more recent times the
            <strong>Roman Road</strong> has taken precedence as the most populated road in the
            village.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name recalls the Roman Road which runs SW/NE across the field
            immediately to the west of the village.&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature form part of the
            metalled road linking the fort of Cardean in the west to the fort at Inverquharity in
            the east and dates from the Agricolan invasion and occupation of 79/87 A.D.
          </p>
          <p>
            The existence of this stretch of road has been known for decades but it was
            spectacularly revealed as a crop marking photographed by Prof. J K St. Joseph and the
            Cambridge Aerial photography group in 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently in 1994 another
            aerial survey of Strathmore by the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments
            Scotland revealed two more sections of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the west and 200 metres
            south of Reedie Farm lay a continuation of Westmuir&rsquo;s <strong>Roman Road</strong
            ><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; More curiously a new section of road was discovered at
            Balbrydie Cottage a mile north east of Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section was
            aligned to the most northerly piece of Roman Road known in Britain which was found in
            Caddam Woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would appear that at some point between Westmuir and
            Herdhill the Roman west to east advance up Strathmore temporarily went northwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Might it be that the first structures raised at Westmuir were the leather tents of the
            engineers of the 20th Legion as they swithered about going north or south to avoid
            Kirrie Den and the Tannage Brae?

            &nbsp;&ldquo;an affa guid music teacher&rdquo; and a fine well-respected gentleman. In
            later decades a wider picture of Lindsay Clark began to emerge. He gained strength from
            being a loved family man, an accomplished artist and sharing his musical talents at
            school and in the wider community. This all helped him along the road to recovery after
            being held a Prisoner of War in the Far East during the Second World War.

              the 5th Black Watch at the Front. It is clear from John&rsquo;s poetry that receiving

            February 1915. There is mention of someone named Reedie from Kirriemuir who had sent
            body belts, perhaps with many more knitted items, to the soldiers serving on the front
            line. You can read it by clicking on the link below:

              >In addition to Kathleen&rsquo;s papers and photos we received another welcome
              collection of family photos from Bill Beaton, Canada&nbsp; (nephew of John
              Beaton).&nbsp; Bill, as you may recall from the earlier story is a great Burns
              enthusiast, so his Burns information and family photographs will be added to the
              Museum collection. He sent copies of photographs of his grandparents William and Ann,
              the parents of Lance Corporal John Beaton. There was now only one piece of the puzzle
              still remaining. We had not been able to establish how the two branches of the
              Kirriemuir Beatons could be related to Lance Corporal John Beaton yet appear to not be
              related to each other. Until Bingo! Sincere thanks to Linda Gray who emigrated to
              Australia with her parents and grandmother, Mary Norrie (Beaton) from Westmuir in the
              1950s. Linda persevered and discovered the link.&nbsp;Linda&rsquo;s great, great
              Grandmother was the sister of William Beaton of Mill Street, Grandfather to the
              Canadian Beatons. The family chart explaining the link will also be taken to the
              Museum.

                  Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon, Westmuir left an indelible impression on her peers,
                  enough to last a life time. To so affect folk of your own age group is one thing,

                  younger requires considerable personable and worthy talents. Evelyn Soutar had

            The original story 'Soldiering On . . . . and Magdalene'
            <strong>first appeared on the website in 2015</strong> and this helps to explain more
            fully how the story began. Two of the fascinating features were on page 3,
            <strong>Golden Wedding in the Carse</strong> in the year <strong>1903</strong> and on
            page 4, <strong>The Inchture Express</strong>. That was to have been The End of the
            story!
          </p>
          <p align="center" class="style2">
            However, the website story had been circulating more widely via the internet and by 2019
            descendants from <strong>Australia</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong> and
            <strong>UK</strong> had contacted Westmuir! Without a doubt the star attraction was the
            account of the <strong>Golden Wedding in Pitmiddle</strong>. Enquiries to the website
            often required answers, learning more, and inevitably led to writing Part 2 in 2020.
