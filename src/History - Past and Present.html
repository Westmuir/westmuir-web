      <h3 class="style31"><u>Westmuir&rsquo;s Special Day in March 2019</u></h3>
      <p>
        The closeness of two specially memorable dates which directly affected the residents of
        Westmuir Village and its environs became the focal point for a day of events on
        <strong>Saturday 16th March 2019</strong>.&nbsp; The central figures on those occasions were
        ancestors of the Munro family from nearby Lindertis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally important and in more recent times, has been the immense support from the great
        grandson of <strong>Sir Hugh Munro</strong>. It was
        <strong>Lord Colyton of Lindertis </strong>who made it possible for the village to develop
        its Community Woodland which was opened officially in 2007. The provision of this wetland
        offered the ideal conditions required for wildlife habitat and for the layout of footpaths.
        The Community Woodland has proved to be of great value to village friends of all ages and
        abilities. On 25th August 2007 the Woodland was officially opened and Lord Colyton&rsquo;s
        younger son Tom Hopkinson, Great, Great Grandson of Sir Hugh, planted a tree to mark the
        occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Westmuir&rsquo;s &lsquo;Celebration of Munro&rsquo; - Saturday 16th 2019</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        The community turned out in force for a Celebration Coffee Morning and two Mountain Climbing
        presentations given in the evening. In the morning, stories were shared and good humour was
        the predominant feature of a memorable occasion. There were various displays for people to
        enjoy from Lindertis early 1900s to present times. There was even a
        &lsquo;<em>Future</em>&rsquo; display highlighting the fact that a crowdfunding appeal had
        begun that very day towards the provision of a defibrillator for the village Phone
        Kiosk.&nbsp; The most evocative photograph was the one (probably by Valentines of Dundee)
        taken about 1920, and certainly before the arrival of the Hall or the Phone Kiosk.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was <strong>Sir Torquil Munro</strong> who was the driving force behind the building of
        Westmuir Hall.&nbsp; His determination to see this through was always remembered and his
        continued support as Trustee of the Hall for over 50 years is still logged in the Hall
        Trustees Book. His sister Carmen was also a Trustee for over 50 years and she was the
        representative for the village WRI. The <strong>Celebration Coffee Morning </strong>was well
        attended and the display notices and photographs prompted lots of good
        &lsquo;memories&rsquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The occasion was further enhanced by the continuous slideshow of the
        <strong>West Highland Way</strong> compiled by Richard, a member of the Westmuir Walkers
        Group. Richard has completed the route four times and the walk featured on the slideshow was
        perhaps his most memorable.&nbsp; Along the way Richard and team met a group of walkers from
        Denmark who were enjoying every minute of their hill-walking in Scotland. The Danes carried
        their tents, all walking gear, a couple of musical instruments and their song sheets (mainly
        Beatles songs). Richard had taken his guitar along and with his family team members had
        opted for Bed and Breakfast.&nbsp; The evening &lsquo;rest times&rsquo; along their
        <strong>West Highland Way</strong> route were indeed memorable, when the Danes and Scots met
        up for a beer and a song. Richard was completing his walk in aid of an important charity and
        when he bid the Danes farewell, they presented him with a Whisky bottle container filled
        with money for his charity.&nbsp;&nbsp; This certainly proves that the camaraderie of
        walking in the Hills does exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The highlight of the coffee morning was when Lord and Lady Colyton arrived with son James,
        daughter Katie and grand-daughter Esme. Lord Colyton&rsquo;s full name is Alisdair James
        <strong>Munro</strong> Hopkinson and he is a great grandson of <strong>Sir Hugh</strong>
        <strong>Munro.&nbsp;</strong>It was also very exciting to learn from Pippa, Lady Colyton
        that the name <strong>Munro </strong>continues. Their eldest son is James Patrick
        <strong>Munro</strong> Hopkinson and James&rsquo; son is <strong>Hugh</strong> Nicholas
        <strong>Munro</strong> Hopkinson. Lady Colyton suggested that &ldquo;Perhaps little Hugh
        will become a famous man of the Scottish Hills like his great, great, great Grandfather
        although the early indications are that his twin sister Suzannah has inherited all the
        intrepid <strong>Munro</strong> genes as she&rsquo;s showing distinct signs of
        adventurousness&quot; &ndash; just like Great Granny Fiona!
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the attendees during the morning had connections with Lindertis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
        had spent their childhood years there or their Parents or Grand-Parents had worked at
        Lindertis.&nbsp; Village friends like Robbie and Reta Adam had worked hard for many years
        supporting the village hall and to have a chance for fun and banter with Alisdair, Lord
        Colyton was just &lsquo; the icing on the cake&rsquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evening event was planned entirely to recognise the work of Sir Hugh
        <strong>Munro</strong> who is known far and wide for his contribution towards locating and
        measuring our Mountain ranges in Scotland and particularly those over 3,000ft in height. He
        published his first list of ' <strong>Munros'</strong> in 1891.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two
        presentations on climbing and hill-walking were given with mountain peaks over 3,000ft
        highlighted and of course many climbers over the years have sought to &lsquo;bag&rsquo; all
        282 of them.&nbsp; <strong>Jeremy Morris</strong> spoke first about his own journey through
        the Munros and <strong>Isdale Anderson</strong> then described his long distance high level
        trek of the GR20 in Corsica, which runs the length of the Mediterranean Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evening programme was linked with some aspects of the wider interests and character of
        Sir Hugh.&nbsp; He went to Stuttgart aged 17 to learn German and from there he developed a
        love of serious climbing in the Alps. Later he took an active part in the Basuto Campaign of
        1880 and was awarded a medal and clasp.&nbsp; Sometime later he was appointed as a
        King&rsquo;s Messenger of Foreign dispatches which might have required travelling to unsafe
        destinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Hugh&rsquo;s wife Selina died in 1902 and his young family were clearly very close to
        him.&nbsp; In the spring of 1918 Sir Hugh went over to Tarascon in Provence with his two
        daughters Carmen and Morna. Working with the French Red Cross and aided by his daughters, he
        set up his own Canteen to aid soldiers. In January 1919 all three returned to Tarascon to
        work in the Canteen and to help the troops returning from the war.&nbsp; Sadly, Sir Hugh
        became seriously ill and died on 19th March 1919.&nbsp; His funeral procession at Lindertis
        on 2nd April was followed by pupils and teachers from Westmuir School, Airlie School and
        Kingoldrum School also the Tennantry and staff from Lindertis and many friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evening event was made all the more enjoyable when members of the Munro family came
        along again -&nbsp; Lady Colyton, son Tom and his wife Gemma.&nbsp; Great fun ensued with
        the drawing of the raffle tickets but soon it was time to call it a day. The Celebration Day
        came to a close after Tom with wife Gemma alongside, cut the celebration cake or &lsquo;Cake
        of Tarascon&rsquo; as it became known! This was accompanied by a Glass of Bellini or Kir
        Royale for all present.&nbsp;

      <h3>Lindertis House &amp; The Munro Family</h3>
      <p>
        In 1808 Gilbert Laing Meason purchased the lands of Lindertis, which lies about four miles
        west of Kirriemuir on the north side of the road leading to Blairgowrie. He was the 2nd son
        of Robert Laing the Laird of Strynzie in Orkney and succeed his Cousin Gilbert Meason of
        Moredon, by whose deed of settlement in 1808, took the name and arms of Meason.&nbsp;
        Through his marriage in 1811 to Mary, daughter of William Weymss of Cuttlehill, their
        combined fortune was considerable, and it was lavishly spent on their newly acquired
        property. Between 1814 and 1817 they had the square Castellated House built which formed the
        main building, the design having been drawn up by Elliot of Edinburgh in 1813.
      </p>
      <div>

          hspace="12"
          align="left"
        /><br />
        The policies and gardens had also been laid out by Mr Laing Meason. In fact everything was
        done on a grand scale, with the result that when he died in 1832, his son Magnus
        Laing-Meason fell into financial difficulties and Lindertis was sold in 1838, on behalf of
        the creditors, to the Trustees of
        <strong>Major-General Sir Thomas Munro, Baronet,</strong> who had died in India in 1827. By
        his settlement a certain portion of the considerable fortune which he left to his elder son
        and heir to the Baronetcy was to be invested in land. Lindertis was purchased and managed
        until their ward came of age.

        <p>
          <strong>Thomas Munro, Second Baronet</strong> was born in India in 1819; he made additions
          to the estate with the purchase of Auchendorie and Baldovie in the 1860s. In 1864 he made
          considerable additions to the Lindertis House, one of these being the west wing.
          <strong> Sir Thomas</strong> was never married so on his death in 1901, his younger
          brother <strong>Campbell Munro </strong>became <strong>Third Baronet</strong>.
          <strong>Sir Campbell</strong> was born in India in 1823 and he chose the army as a career
          rising to the rank of Captain in the Grenadier Guards. Through his marriage in 1853 to
          Henrietta Maria Drummond they had nine of a family, of whom the eldest was
          <strong>Hugh Thomas.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hugh Thomas Munro, Fourth Baronet,</strong> was born in 1856. In 1899 the lands of
          Lindertis and Baldovie were conveyed to him by his uncle,
          <strong>Sir Thomas Munro</strong>, and on his father's death in 1913 he took the title 4th
          Baronet. <strong>Sir Hugh Munro</strong> is best remembered for his table of Scottish
          mountains of 3000 feet and over which was published in 1891 in the Scottish Mountaineering
          Club Journal. This caused a great stir among active mountaineers, who saw the challenge of
          climbing all the mountains on the list as a lifetime ambition. Of his total of 538 main
          summits and tops, it is reckoned he had only 3 summits still to climb when he died in
          France in 1919. His son <strong>Torquil,</strong> becoming the 5th Baronet.<strong

        <p>
          <strong>Thomas Torquil Alfonso Munro, Fifth Baronet</strong>, was born in Edinburgh in
          1901 and educated at Winchester. He was best known as a farmer, particularly as an
          Aberdeen Angus breeder and Judge. He got his name in the record books when his Aberdeen
          Angus bull 'Lindertis Evulse' was sold at the Perth Bull Sales, in 1963, for the world
          record price of 60,000 guineas. Many of his other championship bulls were exported to
          other countries. Sir Torquil was well known in his younger days as a host for society
          parties which were attended by pre-war British film stars and for many years he was one of
          the organisers of the Angus County Ball, which he attended in red kilt, jacket and red
          stockings. In 1928 Torquil made it possible for the people of <strong>Westmuir</strong> to
          erect their village hall with the gift of a piece of land.

        />
        <p>
          By <strong>1947</strong> with the family living in the nearby Drumleys House and the large
          mansion house becoming more of a burden than an asset, the main building was stripped of
          all valuable building materials. Special care was taken with the library, with its
          roll-shuttered walnut bookcases and doors that resembled shelves of books.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main building stood for a long time after this as a roofless shell. The west wing was
          converted into flats which were last occupied in 1965/6. For health and safety reasons,
          children playing in the buildings, lighting fires etc., all of buildings were finally
          demolished in <strong>1987</strong>.

        Stuart was first seen on television as a presenter on BBC's Play School in 1964 (he
        regularly presented the programme for more than 20 years), but he is probably best known for
        playing Gunner 'Atlas' Mackintosh in the BBC sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum. Originally from

        &quot;We arrived around 1957, moving from Letham, Angus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a pupil at Forfar
        Academy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I left Forfar Academy, after five years' senior secondary education,
        with an Intermediate Swimming Certificate, which I passed by rescuing a drowning brick from
        the bottom of Forfar Swimming Pool while dressed in my pyjamasl

        <br />
        I was therefore very grateful to Willie Ogilvy, chief printer at the Kirriemuir Herald, for
        my first job as his reporter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was with the Herald, or as it was more unkindly
        known, the two minutes' silence, for eighteen months, during which time the McGugans moved
        from &quot;Carraig&quot; to a house my Dad had had built at the Welton Corner, between
        Forfar and Kingsmuir.<br />
        <br />
        Among my most vivid memories of my time in Westmuir are riding my sister's pony through the
        raspberry fields and up the hills over the road opposite the house: illegally driving my
        Dad's car, while under age, along the great straight stretch of road towards Alyth; and the
        great teenage parties we held in the what used to be the billiard room in
        &quot;Carraig.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

        As we were at the bottom of the hill out of Kirriemuir, any time there was a serious
        snowfall the family played host to stranded lorry and car drivers. &nbsp; I remember my
        parents were thanked by one guy from up Glen Isla with a whole side of
        venison.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        I first started acting around the time I lived in Westmuir, joining the Thrums Dramatic
        Society and the Kirriemuir Amateur Operatic Society - both &nbsp;great places to meet
        girls!&nbsp; One play, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; by Falkland L Cary - weird the useless
        pieces of information which stick in the mind - toured to Lintrathen. &nbsp; The local hall
        was packed, kids in the front rows, courting couples in the middle, Mums and Dads keeping an
        eye on it all at the back.&nbsp; There was a long tea-party scene and we were stuck at the
        very edge of the tiny stage. &nbsp; We were so close to the front row that when I got up to
        leave the tea-party, I discovered someone had tied my shoe-laces together....<br />
        <br />
        After a clutch of newspaper jobs I went to the College of Dramatic Art in Glasgow for three
        years, and I've been in the acting business ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has ranged from
        seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre and theatre tours to
        television shows and series like &quot;It Ain't HAlf Hot, Mum,&quot; &quot;Playschool,&quot;
        &quot;The Chief,&quot; &quot;Tutti Frutti,&quot; &quot;Hamish
        MacBeth,&quot;&quot;Benidorm&quot; etc., etc.<br />
        <br />
        There is one long-lasting response to my stay in Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later I took a
        rush of blood to the head and bought a house in the Languedoc region of the south of France.
        &nbsp; I didn't realise it at the time, but I've since noticed that the view from the house
        in France is identical to the wonderful view I had from my top-floor bedroom in
        &quot;Carraig.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you substitute the sunflowers with potatoes and the
        vines with rasps you've got the same sweeping view from Westmuir down the Strathmore valley,
        with Forfar over to the left, and down towards Perth on the right.&nbsp; Only in France with
        more predictable sunshine.....&quot;<br />
        <br />
        Very best wishes,<br />
        Stuart.

        <span>
          Northmuir, Southmuir and Westmuir were specifically created by the Kirriemuir authorities
          in 1815 ostensibly to allow the town to develop.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Westmuir more than thirty
          smallholdings were laid out to enable handloom weavers and their families to practise
          self-sufficiency whilst plying their trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; However there is evidence to
          suggest that all three hamlets were located on the edges of the town/parish boundaries in
          order to deter local farmers who were encroaching on the town&rsquo;s common
          lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would explain why the Westmuir is a mile out of town and not at
          Herdhill. About a third of the initial buildings survive in one form or another and many
          of the smallholdings and their wells can be located.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition at least two
          communal wells were sunk outside the present shop and in
          <strong>Roman Road</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the smallholdings were located along the
          Airlie/Kirriemuir road which bisects the village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most were sited
          to the north and south of the main road and were reached by paths between the plots and
          fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; These footpaths in time developed into the four side roads on which
          most of the village housing is now to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
        >

        <p>
          To the north of the main road lie <strong>East</strong> and <strong>West Bank</strong>,
          the latter was and sometimes still is known as <strong>Old School Road</strong> or
          <strong>School Brae</strong>, names which explain why it came into use in the 1870s to
          service the new village school.&nbsp; Prior to that date early O.S. maps indicate that the
          western houses of the village were accessed by &lsquo;the Strippie&rsquo; now a wide but
          partially overgrown footpath between the Parish Boundary mound and the property
          boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title is not as one might presuppose a familiar diminutive
          common to locals &ndash; as with &lsquo;Shoppie&rsquo;,&nbsp; but is an actual Old Scots
          term for an approach road.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>East Bank</strong> sometimes known as <strong>Rossiebank</strong> from the
          property at the northern end certainly predates the 1815 village and was the trackway
          which led to <strong>Cloisterbank</strong> whose buildings have disappeared in the last
          fifty years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This farm was reputed to be the site of the late 18thC
          confrontation between the townsfolk of Kirriemuir and the surrounding farmers when
          disagreements over the hoarding and price of grain led to the fisticuffs described in
          Reid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Regality of Kirriemuir&rsquo; as the
          <strong>Battle of Cloisterbank</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the name itself may well
          suggest even greater antiquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1202 A.D.&nbsp; Gilchrist, Earl of Angus
          gifted Kirriemuir Parish Church and the lands which sustained it to the Abbey at Arbroath
          as part of the Abbey&rsquo;s fund-raising to contribute to the fourth Crusade.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          It is not impossible that CLOISTER bank may well relate to some of the arable and grazing
          lands so gifted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be that these rents partially financed the sack of
          Constantinople in 1204?
        </p>
        <p>
          South of the main road lie the Low Road and Roman Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the
          former has always been referred to as The &nbsp;<strong>Low Road</strong>
          may well indicate that in the early years this was the major access route to the lower and
          southern part of the settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly a substantial number of the older
          houses of the village were adjacent to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In more recent times the
          <strong>Roman Road</strong> has taken precedence as the most populated road in the
          village.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name recalls the Roman Road which runs SW/NE across the field
          immediately to the west of the village.&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature form part of the metalled
          road linking the fort of Cardean in the west to the fort at Inverquharity in the east and
          dates from the Agricolan invasion and occupation of 79/87 A.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          The existence of this stretch of road has been known for decades but it was spectacularly
          revealed as a crop marking photographed by Prof. J K St. Joseph and the Cambridge Aerial
          photography group in 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently in 1994 another aerial survey of
          Strathmore by the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments Scotland revealed
          two more sections of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the west and 200 metres south of Reedie Farm
          lay a continuation of Westmuir&rsquo;s
          <strong>Roman Road</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; More curiously a new section of
          road was discovered at Balbrydie Cottage a mile north east of Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This section was aligned to the most northerly piece of Roman Road known in Britain which
          was found in Caddam Woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would appear that at some point between
          Westmuir and Herdhill the Roman west to east advance up Strathmore temporarily went
          northwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Might it be that the first structures raised at Westmuir were the leather tents of the
          engineers of the 20th Legion as they swithered about going north or south to avoid Kirrie
          Den and the Tannage Brae?

        This link leads to an interesting photographic comparison of part of the village with a
        similar view being taken from both the 1950's and the 1980's. It's just like a ''Spot the
        Difference' puzzle and is both interesting and fun to look at. To bring you up to date there
        is also a fine aerial photograph of Westmuir which was taken during the Millenium Year in
        2000.

      <h3>Lindsay Scott Clark - Teacher, Painter, Soldier, Gentleman</h3>

      <p class="history-intro">
        Lindsay Scott Clark, a well known local artist, lived in Westmuir from 1958 until his death
        in 1996.
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        <br />
        Teacher, Painter, Soldier, Gentleman - Mr Lindsay Clark was all of these things and for many
        pupils at Webster&rsquo;s Seminary in Kirriemuir in the 1950&rsquo;s he was simply
        &nbsp;&ldquo;an affa guid music teacher&rdquo; and a fine well-respected gentleman. In later
        decades a wider picture of Lindsay Clark began to emerge. He gained strength from being a
        loved family man, an accomplished artist and sharing his musical talents at school and in
        the wider community. This all helped him along the road to recovery after being held a
        Prisoner of War in the Far East during the Second World War.

      <h3>Lance Corporal John Beaton</h3>

      <p>
        A poem written by a young soldier serving in France in 1915 has re-emerged and in recent
        months touched the lives of family and <br />
        friends both at home and abroad. To read the full account of how this came about

        Since we added the original poem, a
        <strong>second poem</strong> written by John Beaton whilst on active service in France was
        brought to our notice. The Camerons versus the 5th Black Watch enjoying a game of football
        during a lull in the fighting in war-torn France.&nbsp;

        Another astonishing discovery with this new poem is that it was printed and sold locally for
        One Penny ( 1d ) in aid of the Fund for sending tobacco and cigarettes to the 5th Black
        Watch at the Front. It is clear from John&rsquo;s poetry that receiving cigarettes,
        chocolate, candles and letters brought great comfort to soldiers on the front line.Following
        the publication of the Beaton article and the presentation of family papers to the
        Kirriemuir Museum we had a surprise visit. Kathleen Harris, Victoria Street, a great niece
        of John Beaton, decided to offer her Beaton family memorabilia to the Museum and amongst the
        papers and photos was the &lsquo;football &rsquo; poem.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Summer of 2015,<strong> Kirrie Kist's play 'Soldiering On'</strong> was performed in
        and around St Mary's Church in Kirrie. As part of the performance a
        <strong>third</strong> poem by John had been uncovered within a letter written by him in
        February 1915. There is mention of someone named Reedie from Kirriemuir who had sent body
        belts, perhaps with many more knitted items, to the soldiers serving on the front line. You
        can read it by clicking on the link below:

      <p>
        In addition to Kathleen&rsquo;s papers and photos we received another welcome collection of
        family photos from Bill Beaton, Canada&nbsp; (nephew of John Beaton).&nbsp; Bill, as you may
        recall from the earlier story is a great Burns enthusiast, so his Burns information and
        family photographs will be added to the Museum collection. He sent copies of photographs of
        his grandparents William and Ann, the parents of Lance Corporal John Beaton. There was now
        only one piece of the puzzle still remaining. We had not been able to establish how the two
        branches of the Kirriemuir Beatons could be related to Lance Corporal John Beaton yet appear
        to not be related to each other. Until Bingo! Sincere thanks to Linda Gray who emigrated to
        Australia with her parents and grandmother, Mary Norrie (Beaton) from Westmuir in the 1950s.
        Linda persevered and discovered the link.&nbsp;Linda&rsquo;s great, great Grandmother was
        the sister of William Beaton of Mill Street, Grandfather to the Canadian Beatons. The family
        chart explaining the link will also be taken to the Museum.

        Helen Hunphreys, our resident historian, has been liaising with the Commonwealth War Graves
        Commission to pass on details about John Beaton so that they could include these on their

      <h3>Mrs Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon and Westmuir WRI</h3>
      <p class="history-intro">
        Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon, Westmuir left an indelible impression on her peers, enough to last
        a life time. To so affect folk of your own age group is one thing, but to leave a favourable
        lasting impression with youngsters thirty or forty years younger requires considerable
        personable and worthy talents. Evelyn Soutar had these in abundance.
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        There is even a song about Mrs Soutar called 'The Sweet Gracious Lady of Lisdon' which was
        written in the late 1960's by Eila Webster of Viewbank, Westmuir on the occasion of Evelyn
        Soutar's retirement from the Westmuir WRI

      <h3>Soldiering On ~ A Tale of Two Parts</h3>

      <p class="history-intro">
        The original story 'Soldiering On . . . . and Magdalene'
        <strong>first appeared on the website in 2015</strong> and this helps to explain more fully
        how the story began. Two of the fascinating features were on page 3,
        <strong>Golden Wedding in the Carse</strong> in the year <strong>1903</strong> and on page
        4, <strong>The Inchture Express</strong>. That was to have been The End of the story!

      <p class="history-intro">
        However, the website story had been circulating more widely via the internet and by 2019
        descendants from <strong>Australia</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong> and
        <strong>UK</strong> had contacted Westmuir! Without a doubt the star attraction was the
        account of the <strong>Golden Wedding in Pitmiddle</strong>. Enquiries to the website often
        required answers, learning more, and inevitably led to writing Part 2 in 2020.

        Unravelling the distant family members, who they were and where from, was quite a task,
        especially with so very many James, Johns, Williams and Margarets. Be sure to read the

        >&rsquo; on page 5, written by
        <strong>Gamekeeper John Reid Gillies of Lumley Den</strong> in <strong>1936</strong>. Check
        the <strong>Gamekeepers at Glamis Photo</strong> (page 6) and perhaps recognise some of the
        men there? Also, take a look at the<strong> Royal Photograph</strong> on page 9 and maybe
        provide the answer to when this was taken? &lsquo;<strong
          >Getting to know the Sidlaws</strong
        >&rsquo; and Strathmore will hopefully tempt future visitors to the area. It&rsquo;s a
        splendid stretch of countryside &ndash; with lots of history to suit everyone.

        We do hope you enjoy the Soldiering On &lsquo;Past and Present&rsquo; story, written by our
        own local historian Helen Humphreys.
