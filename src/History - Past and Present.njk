        Northmuir, Southmuir and Westmuir were specifically created by the
        Kirriemuir authorities in 1815 ostensibly to allow the town to
        develop.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Westmuir more than thirty smallholdings were
        laid out to enable handloom weavers and their families to practise
        self-sufficiency whilst plying their trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; However there is
        evidence to suggest that all three hamlets were located on the edges of
        the town/parish boundaries in order to deter local farmers who were
        encroaching on the town&rsquo;s common lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would
        explain why the Westmuir is a mile out of town and not at Herdhill.
        About a third of the initial buildings survive in one form or another
        and many of the smallholdings and their wells can be
        located.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition at least two communal wells were sunk
        outside the present shop and in <strong>Roman Road</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Some of the smallholdings were located along the Airlie/Kirriemuir road
        which bisects the village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most were sited to
        the north and south of the main road and were reached by paths between
        the plots and fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; These footpaths in time developed into
        the four side roads on which most of the village housing is now to be
        found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
      >

      <p>
        To the north of the main road lie <strong>East</strong> and
        <strong>West Bank</strong>, the latter was and sometimes still is known
        as <strong>Old School Road</strong> or <strong>School Brae</strong>,
        names which explain why it came into use in the 1870s to service the new
        village school.&nbsp; Prior to that date early O.S. maps indicate that
        the western houses of the village were accessed by &lsquo;the
        Strippie&rsquo; now a wide but partially overgrown footpath between the
        Parish Boundary mound and the property boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title
        is not as one might presuppose a familiar diminutive common to locals
        &ndash; as with &lsquo;Shoppie&rsquo;,&nbsp; but is an actual Old Scots
        term for an approach road.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>East Bank</strong> sometimes known as
        <strong>Rossiebank</strong> from the property at the northern end
        certainly predates the 1815 village and was the trackway which led to
        <strong>Cloisterbank</strong> whose buildings have disappeared in the
        last fifty years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This farm was reputed to be the site of
        the late 18thC confrontation between the townsfolk of Kirriemuir and the
        surrounding farmers when disagreements over the hoarding and price of
        grain led to the fisticuffs described in Reid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Regality of
        Kirriemuir&rsquo; as the
        <strong>Battle of Cloisterbank</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the name
        itself may well suggest even greater antiquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1202
        A.D.&nbsp; Gilchrist, Earl of Angus gifted Kirriemuir Parish Church and
        the lands which sustained it to the Abbey at Arbroath as part of the
        Abbey&rsquo;s fund-raising to contribute to the fourth
        Crusade.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not impossible that CLOISTER bank may well
        relate to some of the arable and grazing lands so gifted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Could it be that these rents partially financed the sack of
        Constantinople in 1204?
      </p>
      <p>
        South of the main road lie the Low Road and Roman Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        fact that the former has always been referred to as The &nbsp;<strong
          >Low Road</strong
        >
        may well indicate that in the early years this was the major access
        route to the lower and southern part of the settlement.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly a substantial number of the older houses of the
        village were adjacent to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In more recent times the
        <strong>Roman Road</strong> has taken precedence as the most populated
        road in the village.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name recalls the Roman Road which
        runs SW/NE across the field immediately to the west of the
        village.&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature form part of the metalled road linking
        the fort of Cardean in the west to the fort at Inverquharity in the east
        and dates from the Agricolan invasion and occupation of 79/87 A.D.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of this stretch of road has been known for decades but it
        was spectacularly revealed as a crop marking photographed by Prof. J K
        St. Joseph and the Cambridge Aerial photography group in
        1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently in 1994 another aerial survey of
        Strathmore by the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments
        Scotland revealed two more sections of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the west
        and 200 metres south of Reedie Farm lay a continuation of
        Westmuir&rsquo;s
        <strong>Roman Road</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; More curiously
        a new section of road was discovered at Balbrydie Cottage a mile north
        east of Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section was aligned to the most
        northerly piece of Roman Road known in Britain which was found in Caddam
        Woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would appear that at some point between
        Westmuir and Herdhill the Roman west to east advance up Strathmore
        temporarily went northwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Might it be that the first structures raised at Westmuir were the
        leather tents of the engineers of the 20th Legion as they swithered
        about going north or south to avoid Kirrie Den and the Tannage Brae?

      <p class="history-intro">
        This link leads to an interesting photographic comparison of part of the
        village with a similar view being taken from both the 1950's and the
        1980's. It's just like a ''Spot the Difference' puzzle and is both
        interesting and fun to look at. To bring you up to date there is also a
        fine aerial photograph of Westmuir which was taken during the Millenium
        Year in 2000.

      <h3>Lindsay Scott Clark - Teacher, Painter, Soldier, Gentleman</h3>

      <p class="history-intro">
        Lindsay Scott Clark, a well known local artist, lived in Westmuir from
        1958 until his death in 1996.
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        <br />
        Teacher, Painter, Soldier, Gentleman - Mr Lindsay Clark was all of these
        things and for many pupils at Webster&rsquo;s Seminary in Kirriemuir in
        the 1950&rsquo;s he was simply &nbsp;&ldquo;an affa guid music
        teacher&rdquo; and a fine well-respected gentleman. In later decades a
        wider picture of Lindsay Clark began to emerge. He gained strength from
        being a loved family man, an accomplished artist and sharing his musical
        talents at school and in the wider community. This all helped him along
        the road to recovery after being held a Prisoner of War in the Far East
        during the Second World War.

      <h3>Lance Corporal John Beaton</h3>

      <p>
        A poem written by a young soldier serving in France in 1915 has
        re-emerged and in recent months touched the lives of family and <br />
        friends both at home and abroad. To read the full account of how this
        came about please<strong>

      <p>
        Since we added the original poem, a
        <strong>second poem</strong> written by John Beaton whilst on active
        service in France was brought to our notice. The Camerons versus the 5th
        Black Watch enjoying a game of football during a lull in the fighting in
        war-torn France.&nbsp;
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Another astonishing discovery with this new poem is that it was printed
        and sold locally for One Penny ( 1d ) in aid of the Fund for sending
        tobacco and cigarettes to the 5th Black Watch at the Front. It is clear
        from John&rsquo;s poetry that receiving cigarettes, chocolate, candles
        and letters brought great comfort to soldiers on the front
        line.Following the publication of the Beaton article and the
        presentation of family papers to the Kirriemuir Museum we had a surprise
        visit. Kathleen Harris, Victoria Street, a great niece of John Beaton,
        decided to offer her Beaton family memorabilia to the Museum and amongst
        the papers and photos was the &lsquo;football &rsquo; poem.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Summer of 2015,<strong>
          Kirrie Kist's play 'Soldiering On'</strong
        >
        was performed in and around St Mary's Church in Kirrie. As part of the
        performance a <strong>third</strong> poem by John had been uncovered
        within a letter written by him in February 1915. There is mention of
        someone named Reedie from Kirriemuir who had sent body belts, perhaps
        with many more knitted items, to the soldiers serving on the front line.
        You can read it by clicking on the link below:

          ></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to Kathleen&rsquo;s papers and photos we received another
        welcome collection of family photos from Bill Beaton, Canada&nbsp;
        (nephew of John Beaton).&nbsp; Bill, as you may recall from the earlier
        story is a great Burns enthusiast, so his Burns information and family
        photographs will be added to the Museum collection. He sent copies of
        photographs of his grandparents William and Ann, the parents of Lance
        Corporal John Beaton. There was now only one piece of the puzzle still
        remaining. We had not been able to establish how the two branches of the
        Kirriemuir Beatons could be related to Lance Corporal John Beaton yet
        appear to not be related to each other. Until Bingo! Sincere thanks to
        Linda Gray who emigrated to Australia with her parents and grandmother,
        Mary Norrie (Beaton) from Westmuir in the 1950s. Linda persevered and
        discovered the link.&nbsp;Linda&rsquo;s great, great Grandmother was the
        sister of William Beaton of Mill Street, Grandfather to the Canadian
        Beatons. The family chart explaining the link will also be taken to the
        Museum.

        Helen Hunphreys, our resident historian, has been liaising with the
        Commonwealth War Graves Commission to pass on details about John Beaton

      <h3>Mrs Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon and Westmuir WRI</h3>
      <p class="history-intro">
        Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon, Westmuir left an indelible impression on her
        peers, enough to last a life time. To so affect folk of your own age
        group is one thing, but to leave a favourable lasting impression with
        youngsters thirty or forty years younger requires considerable
        personable and worthy talents. Evelyn Soutar had these in abundance.
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        There is even a song about Mrs Soutar called 'The Sweet Gracious Lady of
        Lisdon' which was written in the late 1960's by Eila Webster of
        Viewbank, Westmuir on the occasion of Evelyn Soutar's retirement from
        the Westmuir WRI

          Somewhere in Westmuir a Lady doth stay and living for others is always
          her way<br />
          So far and near you&rsquo;ll hear folk say she&rsquo;s the Sweet
          Gracious Lady of Lisdon.<br />
          Children love her it is plain, no one seeks her help in vain<br />
          And that is why she gets this name - The Sweet Gracious Lady of
          Lisdon.<br />
          She thinks of us all the young and the old, to each one in turn her
          love would unfold<br />
          She is a treasure far greater than gold - The Sweet Gracious lady of
          Lisdon.<br />
          May there still be joys in store for the one we all adore the Lord
          Bless her for ever more<br />
          The Sweet Gracious Lady of Lisdon.

      <h3>Soldiering On ~ A Tale of Two Parts</h3>

      <p class="history-intro">
        The original story 'Soldiering On . . . . and Magdalene'
        <strong>first appeared on the website in 2015</strong> and this helps to
        explain more fully how the story began. Two of the fascinating features
        were on page 3, <strong>Golden Wedding in the Carse</strong> in the year
        <strong>1903</strong> and on page 4,
        <strong>The Inchture Express</strong>. That was to have been The End of
        the story!
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        However, the website story had been circulating more widely via the
        internet and by 2019 descendants from <strong>Australia</strong> and
        <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>UK</strong> had contacted Westmuir!
        Without a doubt the star attraction was the account of the
        <strong>Golden Wedding in Pitmiddle</strong>. Enquiries to the website
        often required answers, learning more, and inevitably led to writing
        Part 2 in 2020.

        Unravelling the distant family members, who they were and where from,
        was quite a task, especially with so very many James, Johns, Williams
        and Margarets. Be sure to read the &lsquo;<strong

        >&rsquo; on page 5, written by
        <strong>Gamekeeper John Reid Gillies of Lumley Den</strong> in
        <strong>1936</strong>. Check the
        <strong>Gamekeepers at Glamis Photo</strong> (page 6) and perhaps
        recognise some of the men there? Also, take a look at the<strong>
          Royal Photograph</strong
        >
        on page 9 and maybe provide the answer to when this was taken?
        &lsquo;<strong>Getting to know the Sidlaws</strong>&rsquo; and
        Strathmore will hopefully tempt future visitors to the area. It&rsquo;s
        a splendid stretch of countryside &ndash; with lots of history to suit
        everyone.

        We do hope you enjoy the Soldiering On &lsquo;Past and Present&rsquo;
        story, written by our own local historian Helen Humphreys.
