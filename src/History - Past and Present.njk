        Northmuir, Southmuir and Westmuir were specifically created by the
        Kirriemuir authorities in 1815 ostensibly to allow the town to
        develop.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Westmuir more than thirty smallholdings were
        laid out to enable handloom weavers and their families to practise
        self-sufficiency whilst plying their trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; However there is
        evidence to suggest that all three hamlets were located on the edges of
        the town/parish boundaries in order to deter local farmers who were
        encroaching on the town&rsquo;s common lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would
        explain why the Westmuir is a mile out of town and not at Herdhill.
        About a third of the initial buildings survive in one form or another
        and many of the smallholdings and their wells can be
        located.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition at least two communal wells were sunk
        outside the present shop and in <strong>Roman Road</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Some of the smallholdings were located along the Airlie/Kirriemuir road
        which bisects the village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most were sited to
        the north and south of the main road and were reached by paths between
        the plots and fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; These footpaths in time developed into
        the four side roads on which most of the village housing is now to be
        found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
      >

      <p>
        To the north of the main road lie <strong>East</strong> and
        <strong>West Bank</strong>, the latter was and sometimes still is known
        as <strong>Old School Road</strong> or <strong>School Brae</strong>,
        names which explain why it came into use in the 1870s to service the new
        village school.&nbsp; Prior to that date early O.S. maps indicate that
        the western houses of the village were accessed by &lsquo;the
        Strippie&rsquo; now a wide but partially overgrown footpath between the
        Parish Boundary mound and the property boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title
        is not as one might presuppose a familiar diminutive common to locals
        &ndash; as with &lsquo;Shoppie&rsquo;,&nbsp; but is an actual Old Scots
        term for an approach road.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>East Bank</strong> sometimes known as
        <strong>Rossiebank</strong> from the property at the northern end
        certainly predates the 1815 village and was the trackway which led to
        <strong>Cloisterbank</strong> whose buildings have disappeared in the
        last fifty years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This farm was reputed to be the site of
        the late 18thC confrontation between the townsfolk of Kirriemuir and the
        surrounding farmers when disagreements over the hoarding and price of
        grain led to the fisticuffs described in Reid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Regality of
        Kirriemuir&rsquo; as the
        <strong>Battle of Cloisterbank</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the name
        itself may well suggest even greater antiquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1202
        A.D.&nbsp; Gilchrist, Earl of Angus gifted Kirriemuir Parish Church and
        the lands which sustained it to the Abbey at Arbroath as part of the
        Abbey&rsquo;s fund-raising to contribute to the fourth
        Crusade.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not impossible that CLOISTER bank may well
        relate to some of the arable and grazing lands so gifted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Could it be that these rents partially financed the sack of
        Constantinople in 1204?
      </p>
      <p>
        South of the main road lie the Low Road and Roman Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        fact that the former has always been referred to as The &nbsp;<strong
          >Low Road</strong
        >
        may well indicate that in the early years this was the major access
        route to the lower and southern part of the settlement.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly a substantial number of the older houses of the
        village were adjacent to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In more recent times the
        <strong>Roman Road</strong> has taken precedence as the most populated
        road in the village.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name recalls the Roman Road which
        runs SW/NE across the field immediately to the west of the
        village.&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature form part of the metalled road linking
        the fort of Cardean in the west to the fort at Inverquharity in the east
        and dates from the Agricolan invasion and occupation of 79/87 A.D.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of this stretch of road has been known for decades but it
        was spectacularly revealed as a crop marking photographed by Prof. J K
        St. Joseph and the Cambridge Aerial photography group in
        1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently in 1994 another aerial survey of
        Strathmore by the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments
        Scotland revealed two more sections of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the west
        and 200 metres south of Reedie Farm lay a continuation of
        Westmuir&rsquo;s
        <strong>Roman Road</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; More curiously
        a new section of road was discovered at Balbrydie Cottage a mile north
        east of Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section was aligned to the most
        northerly piece of Roman Road known in Britain which was found in Caddam
        Woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would appear that at some point between
        Westmuir and Herdhill the Roman west to east advance up Strathmore
        temporarily went northwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Might it be that the first structures raised at Westmuir were the
        leather tents of the engineers of the 20th Legion as they swithered
        about going north or south to avoid Kirrie Den and the Tannage Brae?

      <p class="history-intro">
        This link leads to an interesting photographic comparison of part of the
        village with a similar view being taken from both the 1950's and the
        1980's. It's just like a ''Spot the Difference' puzzle and is both
        interesting and fun to look at. To bring you up to date there is also a
        fine aerial photograph of Westmuir which was taken during the Millenium
        Year in 2000.

      <h3>Lindertis House &amp; The Munro Family</h3>
      <p align="left" class="style2">
        In 1808 Gilbert Laing Meason purchased the lands of Lindertis, which
        lies about four miles west of Kirriemuir on the north side of the road
        leading to Blairgowrie. He was the 2nd son of Robert Laing the Laird of
        Strynzie in Orkney and succeed his Cousin Gilbert Meason of Moredon, by
        whose deed of settlement in 1808, took the name and arms of
        Meason.&nbsp; Through his marriage in 1811 to Mary, daughter of William
        Weymss of Cuttlehill, their combined fortune was considerable, and it
        was lavishly spent on their newly acquired property. Between 1814 and
        1817 they had the square Castellated House built which formed the main
        building, the design having been drawn up by Elliot of Edinburgh in
        1813.
      </p>

          align="left"
        /><br />
        The policies and gardens had also been laid out by Mr Laing Meason. In
        fact everything was done on a grand scale, with the result that when he
        died in 1832, his son Magnus Laing-Meason fell into financial
        difficulties and Lindertis was sold in 1838, on behalf of the creditors,
        to the Trustees of
        <strong>Major-General Sir Thomas Munro, Baronet,</strong> who had died
        in India in 1827. By his settlement a certain portion of the
        considerable fortune which he left to his elder son and heir to the
        Baronetcy was to be invested in land. Lindertis was purchased and
        managed until their ward came of age.
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style2">
        <strong>Thomas Munro, Second Baronet</strong> was born in India in 1819;
        he made additions to the estate with the purchase of Auchendorie and
        Baldovie in the 1860s. In 1864 he made considerable additions to the
        Lindertis House, one of these being the west wing.
        <strong> Sir Thomas</strong> was never married so on his death in 1901,
        his younger brother <strong>Campbell Munro </strong>became
        <strong>Third Baronet</strong>. <strong>Sir Campbell</strong> was born
        in India in 1823 and he chose the army as a career rising to the rank of
        Captain in the Grenadier Guards. Through his marriage in 1853 to
        Henrietta Maria Drummond they had nine of a family, of whom the eldest
        was
        <strong>Hugh Thomas.</strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style2">
        <strong>Hugh Thomas Munro, Fourth Baronet,</strong> was born in 1856. In
        1899 the lands of Lindertis and Baldovie were conveyed to him by his
        uncle, <strong>Sir Thomas Munro</strong>, and on his father's death in
        1913 he took the title 4th Baronet. <strong>Sir Hugh Munro</strong> is
        best remembered for his table of Scottish mountains of 3000 feet and
        over which was published in 1891 in the Scottish Mountaineering Club
        Journal. This caused a great stir among active mountaineers, who saw the
        challenge of climbing all the mountains on the list as a lifetime
        ambition. Of his total of 538 main summits and tops, it is reckoned he
        had only 3 summits still to climb when he died in France in 1919. His
        son <strong>Torquil,</strong> becoming the 5th Baronet.<strong

        /><strong>Thomas Torquil Alfonso Munro, Fifth Baronet</strong>, was born
        in Edinburgh in 1901 and educated at Winchester. He was best known as a
        farmer, particularly as an Aberdeen Angus breeder and Judge. He got his
        name in the record books when his Aberdeen Angus bull 'Lindertis Evulse'
        was sold at the Perth Bull Sales, in 1963, for the world record price of
        60,000 guineas. Many of his other championship bulls were exported to
        other countries. Sir Torquil was well known in his younger days as a
        host for society parties which were attended by pre-war British film
        stars and for many years he was one of the organisers of the Angus
        County Ball, which he attended in red kilt, jacket and red stockings. In
        1928 Torquil made it possible for the people of
        <strong>Westmuir</strong> to erect their village hall with the gift of a
        piece of land.

        By <strong>1947</strong> with the family living in the nearby Drumleys
        House and the large mansion house becoming more of a burden than an
        asset, the main building was stripped of all valuable building
        materials. Special care was taken with the library, with its
        roll-shuttered walnut bookcases and doors that resembled shelves of
        books.
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style2">
        The main building stood for a long time after this as a roofless shell.
        The west wing was converted into flats which were last occupied in
        1965/6. For health and safety reasons, children playing in the
        buildings, lighting fires etc., all of buildings were finally demolished
        in <strong>1987</strong>.

        <br />
        &quot;We arrived around 1957, moving from Letham, Angus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
        was a pupil at Forfar Academy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I left Forfar Academy, after
        five years' senior secondary education, with an Intermediate Swimming
        Certificate, which I passed by rescuing a drowning brick from the bottom
        of Forfar Swimming Pool while dressed in my pyjamasl
        <br />
        <br />
        I was therefore very grateful to Willie Ogilvy, chief printer at the
        Kirriemuir Herald, for my first job as his reporter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
        with the Herald, or as it was more unkindly known, the two minutes'
        silence, for eighteen months, during which time the McGugans moved from
        &quot;Carraig&quot; to a house my Dad had had built at the Welton
        Corner, between Forfar and Kingsmuir.<br />
        <br />
        Among my most vivid memories of my time in Westmuir are riding my
        sister's pony through the raspberry fields and up the hills over the
        road opposite the house: illegally driving my Dad's car, while under
        age, along the great straight stretch of road towards Alyth; and the
        great teenage parties we held in the what used to be the billiard room
        in &quot;Carraig.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        As we were at the bottom of the hill out of Kirriemuir, any time there
        was a serious snowfall the family played host to stranded lorry and car
        drivers. &nbsp; I remember my parents were thanked by one guy from up
        Glen Isla with a whole side of venison.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        I first started acting around the time I lived in Westmuir, joining the
        Thrums Dramatic Society and the Kirriemuir Amateur Operatic Society -
        both &nbsp;great places to meet girls!&nbsp; One play, &quot;Bed of
        Roses&quot; by Falkland L Cary - weird the useless pieces of information
        which stick in the mind - toured to Lintrathen. &nbsp; The local hall
        was packed, kids in the front rows, courting couples in the middle, Mums
        and Dads keeping an eye on it all at the back.&nbsp; There was a long
        tea-party scene and we were stuck at the very edge of the tiny stage.
        &nbsp; We were so close to the front row that when I got up to leave the
        tea-party, I discovered someone had tied my shoe-laces together....<br />
        <br />
        After a clutch of newspaper jobs I went to the College of Dramatic Art
        in Glasgow for three years, and I've been in the acting business ever
        since.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has ranged from seasons with the Royal
        Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre and theatre tours to
        television shows and series like &quot;It Ain't HAlf Hot, Mum,&quot;
        &quot;Playschool,&quot; &quot;The Chief,&quot; &quot;Tutti Frutti,&quot;
        &quot;Hamish MacBeth,&quot;&quot;Benidorm&quot; etc., etc.<br />
        <br />
        There is one long-lasting response to my stay in Westmuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Years later I took a rush of blood to the head and bought a house in the
        Languedoc region of the south of France. &nbsp; I didn't realise it at
        the time, but I've since noticed that the view from the house in France
        is identical to the wonderful view I had from my top-floor bedroom in
        &quot;Carraig.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you substitute the sunflowers with
        potatoes and the vines with rasps you've got the same sweeping view from
        Westmuir down the Strathmore valley, with Forfar over to the left, and
        down towards Perth on the right.&nbsp; Only in France with more
        predictable sunshine.....&quot;<br />
        <br />
        Very best wishes,<br />
        Stuart.

      <h3>Lindsay Scott Clark - Teacher, Painter, Soldier, Gentleman</h3>

      <p class="history-intro">
        Lindsay Scott Clark, a well known local artist, lived in Westmuir from
        1958 until his death in 1996.
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        <br />
        Teacher, Painter, Soldier, Gentleman - Mr Lindsay Clark was all of these
        things and for many pupils at Webster&rsquo;s Seminary in Kirriemuir in
        the 1950&rsquo;s he was simply &nbsp;&ldquo;an affa guid music
        teacher&rdquo; and a fine well-respected gentleman. In later decades a
        wider picture of Lindsay Clark began to emerge. He gained strength from
        being a loved family man, an accomplished artist and sharing his musical
        talents at school and in the wider community. This all helped him along
        the road to recovery after being held a Prisoner of War in the Far East
        during the Second World War.

      <h3>Lance Corporal John Beaton</h3>

      <p>
        A poem written by a young soldier serving in France in 1915 has
        re-emerged and in recent months touched the lives of family and <br />
        friends both at home and abroad. To read the full account of how this
        came about please<strong>

      <p>
        Since we added the original poem, a
        <strong>second poem</strong> written by John Beaton whilst on active
        service in France was brought to our notice. The Camerons versus the 5th
        Black Watch enjoying a game of football during a lull in the fighting in
        war-torn France.&nbsp;
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Another astonishing discovery with this new poem is that it was printed
        and sold locally for One Penny ( 1d ) in aid of the Fund for sending
        tobacco and cigarettes to the 5th Black Watch at the Front. It is clear
        from John&rsquo;s poetry that receiving cigarettes, chocolate, candles
        and letters brought great comfort to soldiers on the front
        line.Following the publication of the Beaton article and the
        presentation of family papers to the Kirriemuir Museum we had a surprise
        visit. Kathleen Harris, Victoria Street, a great niece of John Beaton,
        decided to offer her Beaton family memorabilia to the Museum and amongst
        the papers and photos was the &lsquo;football &rsquo; poem.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Summer of 2015,<strong>
          Kirrie Kist's play 'Soldiering On'</strong
        >
        was performed in and around St Mary's Church in Kirrie. As part of the
        performance a <strong>third</strong> poem by John had been uncovered
        within a letter written by him in February 1915. There is mention of
        someone named Reedie from Kirriemuir who had sent body belts, perhaps
        with many more knitted items, to the soldiers serving on the front line.
        You can read it by clicking on the link below:

          ></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to Kathleen&rsquo;s papers and photos we received another
        welcome collection of family photos from Bill Beaton, Canada&nbsp;
        (nephew of John Beaton).&nbsp; Bill, as you may recall from the earlier
        story is a great Burns enthusiast, so his Burns information and family
        photographs will be added to the Museum collection. He sent copies of
        photographs of his grandparents William and Ann, the parents of Lance
        Corporal John Beaton. There was now only one piece of the puzzle still
        remaining. We had not been able to establish how the two branches of the
        Kirriemuir Beatons could be related to Lance Corporal John Beaton yet
        appear to not be related to each other. Until Bingo! Sincere thanks to
        Linda Gray who emigrated to Australia with her parents and grandmother,
        Mary Norrie (Beaton) from Westmuir in the 1950s. Linda persevered and
        discovered the link.&nbsp;Linda&rsquo;s great, great Grandmother was the
        sister of William Beaton of Mill Street, Grandfather to the Canadian
        Beatons. The family chart explaining the link will also be taken to the
        Museum.

        Helen Hunphreys, our resident historian, has been liaising with the
        Commonwealth War Graves Commission to pass on details about John Beaton
        so that they could include these on their website and we are delighted

      <h3>Mrs Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon and Westmuir WRI</h3>
      <p class="history-intro">
        Evelyn Soutar of Lisdon, Westmuir left an indelible impression on her
        peers, enough to last a life time. To so affect folk of your own age
        group is one thing, but to leave a favourable lasting impression with
        youngsters thirty or forty years younger requires considerable
        personable and worthy talents. Evelyn Soutar had these in abundance.
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        There is even a song about Mrs Soutar called 'The Sweet Gracious Lady of
        Lisdon' which was written in the late 1960's by Eila Webster of
        Viewbank, Westmuir on the occasion of Evelyn Soutar's retirement from
        the Westmuir WRI

        The original story 'Soldiering On . . . . and Magdalene'
        <strong>first appeared on the website in 2015</strong> and this helps to
        explain more fully how the story began. Two of the fascinating features
        were on page 3, <strong>Golden Wedding in the Carse</strong> in the year
        <strong>1903</strong> and on page 4,
        <strong>The Inchture Express</strong>. That was to have been The End of
        the story!
      </p>
      <p class="history-intro">
        However, the website story had been circulating more widely via the
        internet and by 2019 descendants from <strong>Australia</strong> and
        <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>UK</strong> had contacted Westmuir!
        Without a doubt the star attraction was the account of the
        <strong>Golden Wedding in Pitmiddle</strong>. Enquiries to the website
        often required answers, learning more, and inevitably led to writing
        Part 2 in 2020.

        Unravelling the distant family members, who they were and where from,

        <strong>1936</strong>. Check the
        <strong>Gamekeepers at Glamis Photo</strong> (page 6) and perhaps
