            We are very fortunate to have on our village doorstep, the
            <strong>RSPB Loch of Kinnordy Reserve</strong>. This shallow loch is
            situated in a natural basin surrounded by farmland and attracts all
            types of <strong>wildlife</strong>. One favourite summer visitor is
            the <strong>osprey</strong> which you can see fishing around the
            loch, while in the winter <strong>whooper swans</strong> and
            <strong>geese</strong> fly in. There are three purpose built hides
            and you're just as likely to see<strong> otters</strong>,
            <strong>red squirrels</strong> and <strong>deer</strong> as
            <strong>wildfowl</strong> not to mention many species of<strong>
              butterflies</strong
            >
            and <strong>dragonflies</strong>. The reserve is open daily from
            dawn to dusk and entrance is free of charge with a voluntary
            donation cairn at the entrance.

          <p class="style2">
            Probably both. Historic maps show that there has always been a wet,
            boggy area in this location, although there is evidence that it was
            used for growing crops in the very distant past. In the early
            1800&rsquo;s it became an industrial site, as the Gairey Burn, which
            takes water away from the loch and down to Kirriemuir, was blasted
            to lower the bed level, and therefore lower the loch. This, together
            with an embankment, allowed the level of the loch to be lowered, and
            Marl was then extracted and taken away for use on surrounding
            farmland. When this work ceased the land was left to re-flood and
            the beginnings of what you see now were formed.

      <p>
        RSPB Loch of Kinnordy is a wetland oasis. It is special for many
        reasons, not only does it have many designations (SSSI, SPA and RAMSAR)
        for its habitat, breeding birds and wintering wildfowl, but it as an
        important area for visitors. Birdwatchers, photographers and walkers
        alike enjoy the hides and trails.

          >Why don&rsquo;t I see grebes or gulls here anymore?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p class="style2">
        Black-necked grebe numbers declined from 1994, until in 1999 only one
        pair attempted to breed, and the last attempt by any was 2001.
        Black-necked grebe have now virtually disappeared from Scotland.<br />
        The gull colony also declined, and only a small number return each
        spring. Between 2000-2006 these birds would desert the nests before
        chicks hatched. The reason for this is still uncertain, but
        possibilities include:<br />
        &bull; changes in the vegetation from low lying bogbean islands to
        taller plants and eventually trees, restricting visibility of birds
        sitting on nests and providing cover for predators<br />
        &bull; natural movement of birds, both species are known to change
        breeding sites suddenly<br />
        &bull; increase in predation of nests noticeable particularly as the
        colony became smaller and fewer birds were present for protection.
      </p>
      <p class="style2">
        From 2007 &ndash; 2011 the Black-headed Gull colony had shown signs of
        recovery with birds staying through to hatching but with high levels of
        predation being a continued issue, the colony has been in decline since
        2011. Black headed gulls are a social bird, they nest in large colonies
        which give them safety in numbers - they can quickly alert one another
        to a threat of predators. The adult birds will alarm call and dive bomb
        the predator with the aim of keeping the chicks safe. A reduced number
        of adults mean this alarm system isn&rsquo;t as effective, so predation
        poses a much bigger threat.&nbsp; For this reason, in 2016, the RSPB
        took action by creating a raft for black headed birds to nest on. This
        raft floats between the natural bogbean islands. It has a gravel bed
        inside for gulls to nest on and Perspex sides keeping mammalian
        predators out. It is hoped that by giving the gulls a safe place to nest
        it will allow the population to increase and so allow that natural alarm
        call system to work effectively in the future.

          the vegetation to help slow water movement, and therefore increase
          silt build up, creating patches of dry land which will eventually
          merge, giving a marsh , then carr instead of the loch. It seems that
          when Kinnordy reached the &lsquo;carr&rsquo; stage (the marsh was
          covered with extensive willow growth) the black-headed gulls were less
          willing to stay to nest. Kinnordy has high nutrient levels which will
          promote the growth of all vegetation, allowing this natural process to
          happen very quickly.

        Naturally it would be expected that a new loch would form nearby, but in
        a highly managed landscape this is not possible. This is why RSPB is
        working to take a step back in time and re-create a place good for
        breeding gulls and waterfowl. There has been a lot of work carried out
        since 2001, including removal and ongoing management of various
        vegetation.

        Through the winter from 2001-2004 the warden, contractors and volunteers
        removed willow from approximately 35ha of the reserve. This was very
        labour intensive as it all had to be carried out by hand, with
        chainsaws, and be burned on site, causing as little damage as possible
        to the fragile marsh community. This has been followed up each year by
        pruning any regrowth, and treating the stumps with herbicide to reduce
        the amount of regrowth. In 2011-2012 the tree removal was extended along
        the north edge of the Loch. This again was very labour intensive and
        made difficult by very wet summer conditions.

        In the autumn of 2001 a semi amphibious machine was used to remove
        vegetation in front of the hides, and in channels which allow water
        movement through the loch to Gairey Burn (the outflow). This means that
        more water birds are now visible from the hides and we are able to
        manage water levels more easily to keep them high through the spring
        when breeding birds need water nearby, and lower them in summer to allow
        us to carry out work in the loch.
      </p>
      <p class="style2">
        In 2010 the channels between the Bogbean islands were beginning to
        narrow and with a team of volunteers the channels were opened up by
        hand. As well as drysuits the team used a canoe to gain access to the
        vegetation.

      <p>
        Removing the willow from the west end uncovered marsh vegetation which
        is ecologically valuable, but will become rank and eventually develop
        back to willow carr if left unmanaged. Initial small trials with a
        strimmer demonstrated the value of cutting this vegetation in the
        summer, leaving shorter vegetation for the following spring, which is
        good for breeding waders. A less labour intensive method, and better as
        there are no cuttings left, is to graze the area, so in 2003 a local
        grazier introduced a few Highland cattle to the reserve and these now
        permanently graze around the edge of the marsh. In 2010 fencing and
        sowing of species rich grassland seed mix was completed on a small field
        to the north of the reserve and this is managed through grazing provided
        by the Highland cattle. Livestock has grazed at Kinnordy ever since and
        as well as cattle over the years there have been Konic ponies and
        Hebridean sheep.
