          Westmuir is linked to Kirriemuir and the surrounding area by a path network. Angus Council
          have produced a
          <a href="PDF Pages/Kirriemuir Path Network Leaflet.pdf" target="_blank"
            >leaflet containing a map</a
          >
          and information about a series of local signposted walks. Printed copies of the leaflet
          are available from the Kirriemuir Library.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="style2">
          The Path Network offers walks of varying distances ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 miles. Longer
          walks can be planned by combining a number of sections from several walks.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="style2">
          A wide range of plant and animal life can be seen on most of these walks, so do allow
          plenty of time to enjoy. It is also worth taking binoculars if you have them . . . . there
          are some lovely views and of course the

          is a huge attraction for bird watchers with it's hides and wetland walkways.

          Each season of the year brings a different character to all of the walks on the
