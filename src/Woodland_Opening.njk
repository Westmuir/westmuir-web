        activities were enjoyed by all and helped to add a magical content to
        the day for all the younger members.

          Following the ribbon cutting ceremony a symbolic tree planting was
          carried out by Tom Hopkinson. Tom is the son of Lord Colyton and
          thanks were expressed for all their assistance and in particular for
          leasing the land to the community. The rowan tree, which was to be
          known as the Colyton Rowan, was very generously donated by our well
          known plant specialist Ian Christie. Sadly, due to the wet, heavy soil
          the Rowan has since died. Undaunted, it has already been replaced by
          an Oak tree on a mound with a drainage ditch. The Oak is more suited
          to this type of site and once established should grow away
          satisfactorily.
