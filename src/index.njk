                Eila Webster, our resident poet who, 95 years young, like most

                time as any to give Eila a wee break from the monthly task of
                penning a topical poem for us, so why not head over to her
                Poetry Page and read some of the many she has written for us

                  for a difficult job well done by the guys from
                  <strong>Gowanbank Tree Services</strong>, Forfar:<strong>
                    Halim, Duncan and Steven</strong
                  >. They removed two groups of severely leaning trees which
                  threatened the footpath junction at the West end of our
                  Woodland Park.

                <p>
                  We shall shortly be looking for volunteers to arrange the
                  felled timber into habitat piles for the benefit of bugs and
                  beasties of the Park. The stumps, being willow, will no doubt
                  produce new growth in the future but we now have the
                  opportunity to plant new trees to fill in the huge gap.

                  We are delighted to see the installation of two new
                  <strong>Flower Tubs</strong>
                  in Westmuir. The recent Coffee Morning held on 14 September
                  2019 raised over &pound;450 which has been allocated between
                  the Renovation of the Hall Kitchen, the Provision of
                  Additional Equipment for the Westmuir Litter Pick Team and the
                  purchase of the New Tubs which will brighten up both the
                  entrances to Westmuir. Angus Council kindly provided and
                  delivered the compost and a small team of
                  <a

                  >
                  worked hard to locate and fill the tubs which are already
                  planted with Pansies. These are winter hardy and will provide
                  an early show of colour to welcome locals and visitors alike.
                  As well as contributing to the project, Angus Council has
                  removed the bench from the corner of the village car-park and
                  this will be refurbished free of charge before being
                  re-installed. Thanks to Helen, Jim and Mr Mitchell of A.C.

                  Our new defibrillator is now up and running and can be found
                  within the newly restored telephone box outside the village
                  shop. The launch event took place on Friday July 26th and our
                  local community and friends turned out in force to see
                  Westmuir's own
                  <strong>Ian Christie</strong>, internationally renowned rock
                  garden and alpine specialist, cut the golden ribbon to mark
                  this important addition to the village. Also taking part were
                  <strong>Mhairi Anderson</strong>, Chair of Westmuir's Tot's
                  Time and <strong>Johanna Watson</strong>, Vice President of
                  Westmuir's WRI.

                  The comissioning ceremony was immediately followed by an
                  excellent CPR and Defibrillator Awareness Session attended by
                  about 25 people which was given by<strong> Ian Dargie</strong>
                  of

                    >Training 4 Life Scotland</a
                  >. This has been a superb effort all round by the local

            <div>
              <p>
                Thanks once again to everyone who contributed to a busy day in
                the Woodland Park on
                <strong>Saturday 28th October</strong>
                when
                <strong>Phase 2</strong>
                of the new all weather path was completed by spreading a top
                layer of whin dust to complete the project, made possible by
                funding received from 'Paths for All' and Scottish Natural
                Heritage.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a great community effort coordinated by the
                <strong>Westmuir Community Development Trust</strong>
                and thanks are due not only to
                <strong>Jim Millar</strong>
                and
                <strong>Ian Cobb</strong>
                who kept the project on track, but also to all our volunteers
                who loaded loaders, shovelled &amp; brushed, raked &amp; tidied
                up and willingly gave up so much time and effort to complete the
                work so efficiently.
